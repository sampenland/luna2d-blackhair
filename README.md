# LUNA 2D
Welcome to Loony Luna's 2D game engine: name inspired by a book, created for a dog, used by one human.

This is a hobby project to understand the workings of a Game Engine, but not only is this project an engine, 
it is the engine which will run 'The Hunter: From Nothing' a semi-open world survial game combining concepts from games such as
Ark: Surival Evolved, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, Age of Empries, and more.
